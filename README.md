# Customer_Behaviour_Analysis_-_Dannys_Diner

This project and the data used was part of a case study which can be found [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/). It focuses on examining patterns, trends, and factors influencing customer spending in order to gain insights into their preferences, purchasing habits, and potential areas for improvement in menu offerings or marketing strategies in a dining establishment.

## Background
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen. Danny’s Diner is in need of assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

## Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favorite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalized experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.
